# HRMS Lite

HRMS Lite is a lightweight, web-based Human Resource Management System designed to manage employee records and track daily attendance.  
The application simulates a basic internal HR tool with a clean, usable, and production-ready interface.

This project was built as a full-stack assignment to demonstrate end-to-end development skills, including frontend development, backend API design, database persistence, validation, and deployment.
